Notification Platform Queue Recommendation - Summary
Recommendation: Use FIFO Queue

Why FIFO is the Right Choice
1. Safety First

✅ No duplicate notifications - Built-in deduplication (no duplicate emails/SMS)
✅ Guaranteed order - Users receive logical notification sequences
✅ Reliable retries - Failed messages don't break the sequence
✅ Predictable behavior - Fewer edge cases and surprises

2. Simplicity

✅ Less code to write - Queue handles ordering and deduplication
✅ Fewer bugs - No complex application logic for handling duplicates/ordering
✅ Easier debugging - Predictable message flow
✅ Simpler operations - Less monitoring complexity

3. Handles All Use Cases

✅ Sequential flows - Onboarding sequences, workflows, course progressions
✅ Independent events - Assignment completions, social notifications, reminders
✅ Mixed scenarios - One queue for everything

4. Throughput is NOT a Problem

Common misconception: "FIFO limited to 300 msg/sec"
Reality: 300 msg/sec per MessageGroupId
Scale method: Use MessageGroupId = user_${userId}
Example: 10,000 users = 10,000 groups × 300 = 3,000,000 msg/sec total
Typical need: 100K notifications/day = ~1.15 msg/sec average
Conclusion: FIFO has 100,000x more capacity than needed

5. Same Cost

Both Standard and FIFO cost $0.40 per million requests
No price difference - decision based on functionality only

MessageGroupId Strategy
Recommended Approach:
Option 1: Per-User Grouping (Simplest)
MessageGroupId = "user_123"

All notifications for a user process in order
Different users process in parallel
Good for: Most notification platforms

Option 2: Per-User-Per-Category (Better parallelism)
MessageGroupId = "user_123_assignments"
MessageGroupId = "user_123_social"

Assignment notifications don't block social notifications
Maximum parallelism per user
Good for: High-volume platforms


Real-World Capacity Example
Typical Learning Platform:

100,000 daily active users
5 notifications per user per day
500,000 notifications/day total
Average: ~6 messages/second
Peak (10x spike): ~60 messages/second

FIFO Capacity:

With per-user grouping: 100,000 groups × 300 msg/sec = 30 million msg/sec
Your needs: 60 msg/sec
Headroom: 500,000x more than needed ✓


Use Cases Covered
✅ Sequential Notifications (FIFO's strength)

Onboarding sequences (Welcome → Profile → First action)
Course progressions (Module 1 → Module 2 → Module 3)
Approval workflows (Submitted → Review → Approved)
Multi-step forms

✅ Independent Notifications (FIFO works fine)

Assignment completed
Comment received
Due date reminders
Social interactions
System alerts

✅ Time-Sensitive (FIFO is fast enough)

Real-time alerts
Urgent reminders
Critical notifications

Configuration Essentials
Queue Settings:

Queue name: notifications.fifo
Deduplication scope: messageGroup (per user)
Throughput limit: perMessageGroupId (maximum parallelism)
Visibility timeout: 60 seconds
Max retries: 3 (then move to DLQ)
Dead letter queue: notifications-dlq.fifo

Message Parameters:

MessageGroupId: user_${userId} (ensures per-user ordering)
MessageDeduplicationId: ${eventId} (prevents duplicates)
MessageBody: Notification payload (JSON)


Common Concerns Addressed
"FIFO is slower"
❌ Myth - FIFO processes messages just as fast
✅ Truth - Both have millisecond-level latency
"FIFO has low throughput"
❌ Myth - 300 msg/sec is "too low"
✅ Truth - 300 msg/sec per group, scales to millions with multiple groups
"FIFO causes blocking"
❌ Myth - All notifications block each other
✅ Truth - Only messages in same MessageGroupId block (by design)
"FIFO is complex"
❌ Myth - FIFO requires more code
✅ Truth - FIFO is simpler (queue handles ordering/dedup)

Bottom Line
Choose FIFO Because:

Safer - No duplicates, no out-of-order issues
Simpler - Less code, fewer bugs
Sufficient - More than enough throughput
Versatile - Handles all notification types
Same cost - No price penalty
Better UX - Logical notification flow
Easier ops - Simpler to debug and monitor

The Throughput "Limitation" is Not Real

With proper MessageGroupId strategy, FIFO scales to millions of msg/sec
Far exceeds any notification platform's actual needs
300 msg/sec per group × thousands of users = massive total capacity


Final Answer
Use FIFO Queue for your notification platform.
It's safer, simpler, and scales more than enough. The perceived "limitations" don't apply to real-world notification platforms when you use proper message grouping.
Keep it simple. Use FIFO. Sleep better. ✅
